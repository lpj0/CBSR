Learning Cascaded Convolutional Networks for Blind Single Image Super-Resolution
# Abstract
Thispaperstudiestheblindsuper-resolutionofreallow-qualityandlow-resolution (LR) images. Existing convolutional network (CNN) based approaches usually learn a single image super-resolution (SISR) model for a specific downsampler (e.g., bicubic downsampling, blurring followed by downsampling). The learned model, however, is tailored to the specific downsampler and fails to super-resolve
real LR images which are degraded in more sophisticated and diverse manners. Moreover, the ground-truth high-resolution (HR) of real LR images are generally unavailable. Instead of learning from unpaired real LR-HR images or a specific downsampler, this paper learns blind SR network from a realistic, parametric degradation model by considering blurring, noise, downsampling, and even JPEG compression. In contrast to direct blind reconstruction of HR image, the proposed model adopts a cascaded architecture for noise estimation, blurring estimation,
and non-blind SR, which can be jointly end-to-end learned from training data and benefit generalization ability. By taking the bicubicly upscaled LR image as input to non-blind SR, the proposed method can present a single unified model for blind SR with any upscaling factors and varying degradation parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably on synthetic and real LR images.
