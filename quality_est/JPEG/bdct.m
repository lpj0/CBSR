% BDCT Blocked discrete cosine transform
%
%    B = BDCT(A) computes DCT2 transform of A in 8x8 blocks.  B is
%    the same size as A and contains the cosine transform coefficients for
%    each block.  This transform can be inverted using IBDCT.
%
%    B = BDCT(A,N) computes DCT2 transform of A in blocks of size NxN.
