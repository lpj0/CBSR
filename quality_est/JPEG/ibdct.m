% IBDCT Inverse blocked discrete cosine transform
%
%    B = IBDCT(A) computes inverse DCT2 transform of A in 8x8 blocks.  B is
%    the same size as A and contains the cosine transform coefficients for
%    each block.  This transform is the inverse of BDCT.
%
%    B = IBDCT(A,N) computes inverse DCT2 transform of A in blocks of size NxN.
