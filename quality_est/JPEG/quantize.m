% QUANTIZE  Quantize BDCT coefficients
%
% QCOEF = QUANTIZE(COEF,QTABLE) computes the quantizer indices (quantized
% coefficients) for coefficients COEF given quantization table QTABLE.  
%
% QTABLE is applied to each coefficient block in COEF (shaped as an image)
% as follows: new value = round(old value / table value)
